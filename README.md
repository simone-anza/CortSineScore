# CortSineScore

A package to compute a single scalar metric for diurnal cortisol cycle analysis â€” the Cortisol Sine Score (CSS).
Model-free, robust, and ideal for regression, classification, and biomarker research.
---------
ðŸš€ Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub using:

install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("simone-anza/CortSineScore")

# ðŸ§  What is the Cortisol Sine Score?

The Cortisol Sine Score (CSS) is a simple scalar index calculated as:

CSS = âˆ‘ cortisol_i Ã— sin(2Ï€ Ã— time_i / 24)

-------------------------
# Where:
time_i is extracted from column names like time_0600, time_1400, etc.

The sine function gives positive weights to morning timepoints and negative weights to evening timepoints.

You only need a minimum of 4 timepoints (2 before and 2 after 12:00).
----------------------------------------
âœ… Interpretation

Positive CSS â†’ Morning-aligned cortisol profile

Negative CSS â†’ Evening-shifted or inverted profile

Near 0 CSS â†’ Blunted or flat profile
--------------------------------
ðŸ’¡ Why use CSS?

Feature	Description

âœ… Model-free	No curve fitting, no assumptions about waveform shape

âœ… Scalar output	Perfect for regression, classification, clustering

âœ… Flexible	Works with any number of cortisol timepoints

âœ… Lightweight	One-line computation from raw values

---------------------------------
ðŸ”¬ Example

library(CortSineScore)

df <- tibble::tibble(
  Volunteer.ID = c("S1", "S2"),
  time_0200 = c(2.1, 1.3),
  time_0600 = c(5.4, 3.2),
  time_1000 = c(4.8, 2.5),
  time_1400 = c(3.2, 1.6),
  time_1800 = c(1.0, 1.2),
  time_2200 = c(0.5, 0.6)
)

compute_css(df)


Youâ€™ll get a single column cortisol_sin_score per subject â€” summarizing their 24h profile.

ðŸ“¦ Features

ðŸ”¹ Extracts time from column names (e.g., time_0600)

ðŸ”¹ Works with as few as 4 timepoints (2 before and 2 after noon)

ðŸ”¹ Optional verbose = TRUE returns per-timepoint contributions

ðŸ”¹ No dependence on waveform shape â€” no model assumptions

ðŸ”¹ Easily integrates into downstream analysis pipelines
